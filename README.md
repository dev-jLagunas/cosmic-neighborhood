# Cosmic Neighborhood

**Live Site:** [CosmicNeighborhood](https://dev-jlagunas.github.io/cosmic-neighborhood/#/)

Cosmic Neighborhood is an expanded and enhanced version of a Frontend Mentor challenge, showcasing an immersive and interactive space-themed website. Users can explore comprehensive information about the planets in our solar system, with each planet having its own dedicated page, complete with tabs for detailed information.

One of the standout features of this project is the interactive 3D models of the planets, created using Three.js. Users can zoom in, view the planets from different angles, and engage with the models for a more dynamic experience.

This project is built with modern web technologies, including Vue, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
